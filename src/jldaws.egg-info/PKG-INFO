Description: 
        Overview
        --------
        
        This package contains a collection of Amazon Web Service related scripts e.g.
        
        * jldsqsjob : wait for stdin trigger, dequeue msg(s) from SQS Q#1, send to stdout, requeue to SQS Q#2, delete msg(s) from Q#1
        * jlds3upload : automated file upload to S3
        * jlds3download : automated file download from S3
        * jldrxsqs : receive from an SQS queue to JSON/string stdout (with optional stdin trigger)
        * jldtxsqs : transmit on SQS JSON/string from stdin
        * jldleader: distributed leader election protocol manager
        * jlds3up  : simple file upload to s3 with functionality to delete 'old' files
        * jlds3list : listing files in an S3 bucket
        * jldsdb: list, create and delete operations on SDB
        * jldsdbget: retrieve entries in SDB
        * jldsdbinsert: insert records in SDB
        * jldsdbbatchinsert: batch insert records in SDB from file
        
        The philosophy behind these scripts is:
        
        * simplicity  : each script only does 1 thing
        * reporting   : status & error reporting through stderr and (optionally) JSON stdout
        * data driven : object in from src ==> object out to dst
        * data flow   : piping through stdin / stdout    
        
        Scripts can easily be "composed" through standard Linux piping :
        
            jldrxsqs @config1.txt | some_other_command | jldtxsqs @config2.txt
        
        The data format used is JSON.
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Can be performed through options on the command line or using a file (use a leading `@`).
